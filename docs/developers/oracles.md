# Oracle Machines (OMs)
Oracle Machines in Qubic act as a bridge between smart contracts and real-world data. They enable smart contracts to interact with external information through the Qubic Protocol Interface (QPI). These oracles, functioning as software agents, fetch real-world information and feed it into the network. Understanding Oracle Machines is crucial for writing powerful smart contracts in Qubic.

Key Points:
- Oracle Machines facilitate querying real-world data.
- Interaction with OMs is managed via QPI.
- OMs simplify the process of incorporating external data, allowing developers to focus on smart contract logic.
