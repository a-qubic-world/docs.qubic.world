# Contribute to Qubic

Qubic is more than just a decentralized network; it is a community-driven ecosystem, which thrives on the contributions of its diverse and dedicated members. As we embark on this journey of building an equitable, decentralized future, we're calling upon the talents and creativity of developers and marketers like you.

## Why do we need you?

Innovative and efficient development is at the heart of Qubic's technology. It's the developers who breathe life into our ecosystem by building robust applications, crafting smart contracts and enhancing the core functionality of the network.

Meanwhile, skilled marketers help us convey the potential and value of Qubic to a wider audience, ensuring that our community continues to grow and that the network's benefits reach as many people as possible.

Take a look at our current community bounties and start contributing your unique skills to this innovative ecosystem. Remember, when you deliver quality work, the quorum can vote on the final proposal and release the QUs you've earned. This ensures that your hard work and dedication are recognized and rewarded.

Whether you're coding the next big smart contract or helping to spread the word about Qubic, your contributions shape our collective future. Let's make a difference together in the Qubic ecosystem.

## How we fund these projects

The Computor Controlled Fund (CCF) is a communal resource designed to support and facilitate the growth of the Qubic ecosystem. The fund allocates resources to approved projects that aim to expand the capabilities, reach, or efficiency of the Qubic network. Any community member can propose a project for funding and the projects are chosen based on the votes of the community members (see how [Proposal](/learn/proposals) work). The idea behind the CCF is to enable quick definition of project proposals and release of budgets by the community.
