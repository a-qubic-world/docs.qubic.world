Welcome to the Qubic Learning Center! This is your comprehensive guide to understanding the unique aspects of the Qubic ecosystem. Whether you're new to Qubic or looking to deepen your knowledge, our carefully curated resources are designed to offer you a thorough understanding of Qubic's key features, its advanced technology and the role you can play within the network. 

Qubic is a pioneering project that combines the capabilities of **Distributed Ledger Technology** and [Smart Contracts](/learn/smart-contracts), introducing unique features such as frictionless microtransactions, energy as the transaction medium ([Qubic Units](/learn/tokenomics) or QUs), decentralized [quorum-based decision making](/learn/quorum) and scalable [AI solutions](/learn/upow). With its innovative use of epoch-based processing and decentralized exchange, Qubic paves the way for a new era of distributed computing and finance.
