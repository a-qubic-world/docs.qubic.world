# Quorum

## What is Quorum?
A quorum is the minimum number of members required to be present at a meeting or assembly in order for official business to be conducted. The number of members needed to form a quorum is typically defined by the rules or bylaws of the organization holding the meeting.

In many cases, a quorum is required for decisions to be made or votes to be taken. Without a quorum, a meeting may not be able to proceed or any actions taken may be considered invalid.

For example, if the bylaws of a club state that a quorum is a majority of its members, then at least half of the members would need to be present at a meeting for any official business to take place.

## The Qubic Quorum
In Qubic the Quorum is more than just a simple majority — it's a dynamic assembly of 451 [Computors](/learn/nodes) Votes. Any decision that have to be made by the Quorum means that you need at least 451 Votes from Computors. This assembly of Computors is at the heart of decision-making processes within the Qubic system.

The Computors form a democratic ecosystem, with each having an equal vote. The aim is to decentralize power and promote a healthy competition for the system's best interests. This unique form of [Governance](/learn/governance) separates the roles of Computors and [Arbitrator](/learn/arbitrator), ensuring that no single entity can control both.

## Quorum Functions
The Quorum in the Qubic system fulfills key functions:

- Forming and Creating Ticks (Blocks)
- Proposing, Voting for and Accepting Polls

These functions allow for a dynamic, community-oriented, and consensus-driven ecosystem that is key to the operations of the Qubic network.


## Quorum Voting on Proposals
When it comes to voting, a decision is considered valid when it has received the approval of at least 451 Computors. The [Proposal](/learn/proposals) with the most votes wins, fostering a system of majority rule.

This requires a broad consensus and encourages active participation from Computors in order to make impactful decisions. In scenarios where there are two decision proposals, the winning option must secure at least 50% of the votes (or at least ⅓ of all Computors, if only ⅔ are participating). In scenarios where there are multiple options, the winning proposal is chosen by the most votes — still provided that at least 451 Computors have cast a vote.
