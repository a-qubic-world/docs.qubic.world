In the ever-expanding crypto universe, where digital currencies flow and groundbreaking technologies emerge, an exciting event unfolded. This was the story of the inaugural Qubic [Smart Contract](/learn/smart-contracts) [IPO](/learn/ipo): Qx.

Qx is a decentralized exchange (DEX) with a vision to transform how digital assets are traded. With 676 sought-after shares on offer, anticipation surged amongst crypto enthusiasts who eagerly followed the live auction.

The enthralling auction took place during Epoch 65, lasting from July 12th to July 19th, 2023. Investors and enthusiasts had the opportunity to participate in this historic event and become part of the Qubic revolution.

As the auction began, participants including miners, computors, and QU-holders entered a heated bidding war. The atmosphere buzzed with electricity, and bids escalated as everyone vied for the coveted shares.

The auction took the unique form of a [Dutch Auction](/learn/dutch-auction), adding an extra layer of intrigue. The starting price per share was low but gradually increased until the time ran out at 11 UTC on Wednesday, July 19th. The Qubic community watched the entire event unfold live on https://live.qubic.li/ipo, cheering on their favorites and their own bids.

As the auction reached its thrilling conclusion, the success of Qx-IPO became apparent. It marked a triumph for the Qubic ecosystem and showcased the immense potential Qubic Smart Contracts hold for the crypto industry.

The unique aspect of these Qubic SC IPOs is the concept of "burning." The designated [QUs](/learn/tokenomics)  were literally burned, decreasing the total supply with each Smart Contract built on Qubic. Qx-IPO was a testament to this concept. Over 10 trillion QUs were burned during the IPO auction. As a result, the share price soared to an incredible 15 billion QUs per share, resulting in a significant reduction of over 15% in the total supply.

This spectacular auction marked the beginning of a new era for Smart Contracts and demonstrated how they could transform the crypto world through IPOs. Qx-IPO showed that groundbreaking technologies are not just visions, but tangible possibilities shaping our crypto-centric future.

With a resounding success, the Qx-IPO has made its mark in the crypto history books. The journey for Qubic and its Qubic SC IPOs has just begun. The future is brighter than ever and everyone is looking forward to the next chapter of evolution.
